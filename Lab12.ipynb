Now, we must run fibonacci(n-1) again, with this time n being 3. So we're running fibonacci(2), and this time, it returns 1. Again, we have to run fibonacci(n-1) which is fibonacci(1). This also returns 1. Now, we know the return value of fibonacci(n-1), which is (4-1), or fibonacci(3), which is 2, because fibonacci(1)+fibonacci(2)=1+1=2. And we also know the return value of fibonacci(n-2), which is fibonacci(2), and it's 1. Finally, we get the return value of fibonacci(4), which is fibonacci(2)+fibonacci(3)=2+1=3.\n",
